# Lasse Munch

This i a website presenting the bassist Lasse Munch. Right now he is not in a band.
The website is like a resume for Lasse to help him present himself to other bands and show of some of music he has made.

## USER EXPERIENCE
This page is basically for at band, but the band only has a bassist. This should help give insight into what kind of person and bassist Lasse is, in order to find a band that will be a good fit.

This project will help archieve this by showing of the bassist's style and personality. It also provide and easy way to contact Lasse and set up a session for playing music together.

You can check out the wireframe here.

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

JQuery
The project uses JQuery to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Testing
I had Lasse try out the website before the images were interactive with zoom. I also shared my website with others to recieve feedback if anything was dificult to navigate.
It's easy to read a bit about Lasse and learn about him as a bassist and person through the photos. 
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Using the following websites I weeded out erros in my code. I kept my comments as they are even though the html validator warned about the extra hyphens.
https://validator.w3.org/nu/
The css validator claims that my code has 32 errors. All 32 recognised errors are in the Bootstrap library.

Go to the validator pages and paste in the Milestone-1 website url.

I have opened the website on my desktop, and my phone to find out if there are any responsiveness problems.
The trickiest part was the landscape orientation for the mobile format.

The biggest difference between smaller bigger screens is the fontsize of the navigation menu items. 
Besides that all content like videos, photos and paragraphs, is taking up most of the screen on the mobile device format.
The footer and header are fixed in desktop veiw and are absolute in mobile view.

Contact form:
Tested "contact.html"
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears :('check')
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears : ('check')
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears. : ('check')
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.


## Deployment
I deployed using GitHub Pages with the current branch.

There are no differences between the development and the deployment at the moment.

To run the code locally in gitpod type "python3 -m http.server" in the console.
